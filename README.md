# Show-desktop-button

A button that hide/show all the open windows on desktop


## Installation

You can automatically install the extension from the website (automatic installation) or you can download the repo files (manual installation).


**Automatic installation (best option):**

* Install from [webpage](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1194/show-desktop-button/) on gnome extension website.


**Manual installation:**

* Open a terminal and give the command
```
git clone https://github.com/amivaleo/Show-Desktop-Button.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/show-desktop-button@amivaleo
```
* Restart the gnome shell by rebooting or by logout&login or by pressing `alt+f2` then writing `r` and pressing enter.

* Enable the extension in Tweaks.


## Translation

If you'd like to translate the extension in your native language, you can

* download the file `show-desktop-button.pot` which is in the `locale` folder
* open it using `Poedit` or using any other software or by terminal
* translate the string in your language
* save and compile the translation
* rename the resulting file with extension `.mo` to `show-desktop-button.mo`
* send that file to me by opening an issue (in which you MUST specify the language short code, like `it_IT`, `es_ES`, `en_US`, etc) or by a pulling request
